  "landing_text": "Thank You for downloading my first mod. In thi mod you will find some new ores, a new structure, a new dimension and a new mob. The new ores are called Musgravite Ores, these ores can be found underground or in the end islands. This ore can be turned into many different tools which have their own uses. The Abandoned Temple structure contains a chest full of loot but is guarded by some lurking mobs. My new dimension is an ore dimension that makes life easier while trying to find ores. You get there by right clicking the musgravite block crafted of 9 musgravite. And finally, the mole is an entity that spawns in the forest at night and will try to eat you knees. But it hates cats so don't let your cat get too close. ",
